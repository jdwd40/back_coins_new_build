Sure, here's a task list for creating the coins endpoint:

1. [ ] Define the endpoint in the route file (`coinsRoutes.js` or similar):
    - [ ] `GET /api/coins` to get all coins.
    - [ ] `GET /api/coins/:id` to get a specific coin by its ID.
    - [ ] `POST /api/coins` to add a new coin (optional, if you want to allow adding new coins through the API).
    - [ ] `PUT /api/coins/:id` to update a specific coin (optional, if you want to allow updating coins through the API).
    - [ ] `DELETE /api/coins/:id` to delete a specific coin (optional, if you want to allow deleting coins through the API).

2. [ ] Create the controller functions for each endpoint in the controller file (`coinsController.js` or similar):
    - [ ] `getAllCoins` function to handle `GET /api/coins` requests.
    - [ ] `getCoinById` function to handle `GET /api/coins/:id` requests.
    - [ ] `addNewCoin` function to handle `POST /api/coins` requests (optional).
    - [ ] `updateCoinById` function to handle `PUT /api/coins/:id` requests (optional).
    - [ ] `deleteCoinById` function to handle `DELETE /api/coins/:id` requests (optional).

3. [ ] Create the necessary queries in a `coinsModel.js` file (or similar) to interact with the database:
    - [ ] `selectCoins` function to get all coins from the database.
    - [ ] `selectCoinById` function to get a specific coin by its ID from the database.
    - [ ] `insertCoin` function to add a new coin to the database (optional).
    - [ ] `updateCoin` function to update a specific coin in the database (optional).
    - [ ] `deleteCoin` function to delete a specific coin from the database (optional).

4. [ ] Test the endpoint:
    - [ ] Write unit tests for each controller function.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the endpoint.
    - [ ] Manually test the endpoint using a tool like Postman.

5. [ ] Error Handling:
    - [ ] Add necessary error handling for each endpoint.
    - [ ] Test error cases.

6. [ ] Documentation:
    - [ ] Document each endpoint in your API documentation.
    - [ ] Include information like the HTTP method, path, request body (if applicable), and response.

Remember to commit your changes frequently as you complete these tasks. It will be easier to track changes and revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.
