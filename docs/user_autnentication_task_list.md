Here's a breakdown of the tasks for implementing user authentication with a tickable todo list:

1. [ ] Plan the user authentication flow
   - [x] Choose an authentication strategy (e.g., JWT)
   - [ ] Determine the required API routes (e.g., `/register`, `/login`)

2. [ ] Set up the testing environment
   - [ ] Install testing libraries (e.g., Jest, Supertest)
   - [ ] Configure test database and test runner

3. [ ] Write tests for user registration
   - [ ] Test user registration with valid data
   - [ ] Test user registration with missing data
   - [ ] Test user registration with invalid data
   - [ ] Test user registration with duplicate data (e.g., same email or username)

4. [ ] Write tests for user login
   - [ ] Test user login with valid data
   - [ ] Test user login with incorrect email or password
   - [ ] Test user login with missing data
   - [ ] Test user login with invalid data

5. [ ] Implement the registration API endpoint
   - [ ] Create the registration route handler
   - [ ] Validate user input
   - [ ] Check for existing user with the same email or username
   - [ ] Hash the password
   - [ ] Save the new user to the database
   - [ ] Return the created user and an access token

6. [ ] Implement the login API endpoint
   - [ ] Create the login route handler
   - [ ] Validate user input
   - [ ] Check if the user exists
   - [ ] Compare the provided password with the hashed password in the database
   - [ ] Generate and return an access token

7. [ ] Add token-based authentication
   - [ ] Create a middleware to validate the access token
   - [ ] Protect the required routes with the authentication middleware

8. [ ] Test the implemented endpoints and authentication
   - [ ] Run the tests for user registration and login
   - [ ] Manually test the endpoints with a tool like Postman or Insomnia

9. [ ] Refactor and optimize the code if needed
   - [ ] Review the code for any improvements or optimizations
   - [ ] Update tests if any changes are made to the code

By breaking the tasks into smaller steps and organizing them in a logical order, you can ensure a smooth development process for implementing user authentication.
