Sure, here's a task list for creating the coins endpoint:

1. [x] Define the endpoint in the route file (`coinsRoutes.js` or similar):
    - [x] `GET /api/coins` to get all coins.
    - [x] `GET /api/coins/:id` to get a specific coin by its ID.
    - [ ] `POST /api/coins` to add a new coin (optional, if you want to allow adding new coins through the API).
    - [ ] `PUT /api/coins/:id` to update a specific coin (optional, if you want to allow updating coins through the API).
    - [x] `DELETE /api/coins/:id` to delete a specific coin (optional, if you want to allow deleting coins through the API).

2. [x] Create the controller functions for each endpoint in the controller file (`coinsController.js` or similar):
    - [x] `getAllCoins` function to handle `GET /api/coins` requests.
    - [x] `getCoinById` function to handle `GET /api/coins/:id` requests.
    - [ ] `addNewCoin` function to handle `POST /api/coins` requests (optional).
    - [x] `updateCoinById` function to handle `PUT /api/coins/:id` requests (optional).
    - [x] `deleteCoinById` function to handle `DELETE /api/coins/:id` requests (optional).

3. [x] Create the necessary queries in a `coinsModel.js` file (or similar) to interact with the database:
    - [x] `selectCoins` function to get all coins from the database.
    - [x] `selectCoinById` function to get a specific coin by its ID from the database.
    - [ ] `insertCoin` function to add a new coin to the database (optional).
    - [x] `updateCoin` function to update a specific coin in the database (optional).
    - [x] `deleteCoin` function to delete a specific coin from the database (optional).

4. [x] Test the endpoint:
    - [x] Write unit tests for each controller function.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the endpoint.
    - [x] Manually test the endpoint using a tool like Postman.

5. [x] Error Handling:
    - [x] Add necessary error handling for each endpoint.
    - [x] Test error cases.

6. [x] Documentation:
    - [x] Document each endpoint in your API documentation.
    - [x] Include information like the HTTP method, path, request body (if applicable), and response.
