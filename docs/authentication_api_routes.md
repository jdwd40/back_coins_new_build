To implement JWT-based authentication, you'll need at least the following API routes:

1. **User registration**
   - Method: `POST`
   - Route: `/api/users/register`
   - Description: Allows users to create a new account
   - Payload: `{ "username": "john_doe", "email": "john_doe@example.com", "password": "password123" }`

2. **User login**
   - Method: `POST`
   - Route: `/api/users/login`
   - Description: Authenticates users and returns a JWT upon successful login
   - Payload: `{ "email": "john_doe@example.com", "password": "password123" }`

3. **Protected routes**
   - You'll have various protected routes in your app that require JWT authentication. The routes will depend on the specific features of your app. For example:
      - Method: `GET`
      - Route: `/api/portfolio`
      - Description: Fetches the user's coin portfolio

      - Method: `POST`
      - Route: `/api/transactions/buy`
      - Description: Allows users to buy coins
      - Payload: `{ "coin_id": 1, "amount": 5 }`

      - Method: `POST`
      - Route: `/api/transactions/sell`
      - Description: Allows users to sell coins
      - Payload: `{ "coin_id": 1, "amount": 5 }`

      - Method: `GET`
      - Route: `/api/coin-price-history/:coin_id`
      - Description: Fetches coin price history

Remember to protect your routes with the authentication middleware, as described in the previous response. This ensures that only authenticated users with valid JWTs can access the protected routes.
