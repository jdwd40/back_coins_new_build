"Astronomical Syndicate" launched StellarFortune, a cryptocurrency. The group's exact names and intentions are unknown, although they are reported to include eccentric millionaires, smart scientists, and even some former NASA engineers.

The Astronomical Syndicate allegedly found an old extraterrestrial item on a covert space trip. The item included sophisticated technology that suggested a new money that was quicker, more secure, more decentralised than anything on Earth.

The Syndicate constructed the StellarFortune currency after years of researching the item and reverse-engineering its technology. In a private ceremony, they launched it.

The Syndicate's enigmatic beginnings and superior technology piqued the crypto community's and public's interest in the currency. The Syndicate may be linked to covert government agencies and extraterrestrials.

As the currency gained traction, investors and crypto enthusiasts supported the Syndicate. The Syndicate utilised these cash to advance technology and conceal their identity.
